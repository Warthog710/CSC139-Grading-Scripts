# CSC139-Grading-Scripts
The grading scripts I used to grade CSC139 (Operating Systems) for Dr. Shobaki at Sacramento State University

#### Assignment 1
Used ``grading_asgm1.py`` to sort, rename, and compile all submission. The shell script ``grade_test_cases.sh`` (written by a previous grader that I do not know) was modified and used to work with my test cases. The last test case was manually ran on each submission.

#### Assignment 2
Used ``grading_asgm2.py`` to sort, rename, check for plagirism (needs to be updated each semester), compile, and run all test cases. All errors were recorded. Each student's report was then tested against the output of their code to produce valid output.
